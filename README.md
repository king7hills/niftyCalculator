# niftyCalculator
A nifty calculator combining what I've learned in html, css, and javascript. This is the final project for the Odin Project Foundations Course.

1.7.25
Started this project on 1.5.25 and created the starting html structure as well as much of the CSS.
On 1.6.25, I finished up the CSS structure and began the scripting.
Today, I finished all of the scripting.

There are bugs I'm working out including too many digits overflowing the display, just realized my sum function concatenated my input strings, etc.

1.8.25
Solved the digit clearing problem by implementing conditional logic on the digit event listeners.
